# Roadmap

## Before Lunch

1. Plug in the API key X
1. Edit the REST function to access the Json file X
1. Enable the JSON to console log on Chrome and show the objects X

## 30 Min Before Lunch

1. Decide what we want to extract from the JSON File in the function - photo, lunch spot, 
1. Start working on the function to extract the name of a lunch spot

       console.log(json);
       console.log(json.response);
       console.log(json.response.groups);
       console.log(json.response.groups[0]);
       console.log(json.response.groups[0].items);
       console.log(json.response.groups[0].items[0]);
       console.log(json.response.groups[0].items[0].venue);


1. Get that name to appear in console
1. Start working on the function to extract the appropriate info


## Post Lunch 1-2

1. get one restaurant name to appear on webpage X
1. extract one photo from json object X
1. make it show X
1. change photo flag to 1 X
1. figure out how to make it show one thing in our area (get this done today)
1. confirm that things it shows us are near us (we can use a predetermined location- PCS?)
1. it should show us more than just one of the spots near us
